      The OP-1 – machine itself – has an interesting feature – sampling radio stations. I travel a lot.
      And in different cities, radio waves carry the local flavour. That’s why my music starts with recorded bits of songs from various cities and countries,
      which I later reassemble like a puzzle on the OP-1. The tracks titles will hint at their origins.
      Some parts were later reworked in the studio, and partially vocals were added.
      It is a unique experience of recording a moment, an occurrence that cannot be predicted.
      It's radio, after all – you can't rewind it. Literally, it’s like a hunt for the right piece of music.
      Because you had to press the "record" button in advance: even before the desired piece of music started playing.
      That’s the concept. And then it’s a matter of taste.
