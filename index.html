        The OP-1 – machine itself – has an interesting feature – sampling radio stations. I travel a lot.
        And in different cities, radio waves carry the local flavour. That’s why my music starts with recorded bits of songs from various cities and countries,
        which I later reassemble like a puzzle on the OP-1. The tracks titles will hint at their origins.
        Some parts were later reworked in the studio, and partially vocals were added.
        It is a unique experience of recording a moment, an occurrence that cannot be predicted.
        It's radio, after all – you can't rewind it. Literally, it’s like a hunt for the right piece of music.
        Because you had to press the "record" button in advance: even before the desired piece of music started playing.
        That’s the concept. And then it’s a matter of taste.
